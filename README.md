### Hi there, Welcome to  DSC COEAðŸ‘‹

Developer Student Clubs<br>
Helping students bridge the gap between theory and practice.<br>
Developer Student Clubs are university based community groups for students interested in Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a DSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.
